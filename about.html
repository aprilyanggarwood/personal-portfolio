                My name is April. I have a lot of sales, customer service, and
                marketing work experience with my priviouse and current jobs
                both in China and America. My work experiences have taught me to
                ask questions and pay attention to detail, as these are really
                important for people to succeed in their career.
              </p>
              <p class="p1">
                Humility, teamwork, and curiosity are my strengths in both my
                professional and educational career. I believe that everyone
                around me could be my teacher/mentor in my life and career.
              </p>
              <p class="p1">
                Good collaboration and a good relationship with colleagues can
                make us more efficient and productive during our daily work.

                Currently, I am pursuing my bachelor degree in Web Development
                at Bellevue University. I am motivating myself to learn computer
                coding skills because there are more job opportunities in this
                job field, and my interest and curiosity brought me into this
                field. I love to keep my skills up to date in order to better
                fit this new tech world.

                Today, as we know, more and more people love/need to use the web
                or mobile applications to do more things at their convenience.
                Therefore, my goals in my future tech career are to help
                companies to create and develop easy-to-use applications based
                on company and userâ€™s needs in order to build an online channel
                for both sides to efficiently interact and communicate 24/7.
